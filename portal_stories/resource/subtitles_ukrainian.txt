		"cave.cave_02"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: Ви тут тому що, ви — найкраще, що може запропонувати світ. Зауважте, що мені було не так легко це сказати, тож сприймайте це як один з найкращих компліментів у своєму житті! Навіть, якщо ви не знаєте, хто я такий! Перш за все, я заснував компанію, що займалася виготовленням штор для ванної. Вона виробляла азбестовмісні штори для військовий, а я продовжував мріяти про її розростання та покращення."
		"cave.cave_03"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: І знаєте, я почав працювати над тим, щоб здійснити ці мрії. Багато працювати. Що й привело вас сюди. Ви їдете в Мічиган, у маленьке містечко, що називається… Чекайте, давайте ще раз — де ми? Ага… Гаразд, отже це містечко ще не має назви, ми його самі побудували. АЛЕ, це неважливо. Суть в тому, що ви їдете сюди. І скоро ви будете у Aperture: Science Innovators."
		"cave.cave_04"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: We’re still getting some of this stuff together, but there’s a lot of science we can do in the meantime. You’ve been selected from a large group of candidates for a special test in our temporary testing areas. When the train arrives at the station, head into the town and into the Aperture building. Don’t worry though, you’ll know where it is. You’ll get some more pre-recorded messages once you’re there. Now, get ready to do some science! In the meantime, we’re going to put on some nice music for you. Enjoy the ride!"
		"cave.cave_05"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: Alright, you’re now arriving Aperture Central statoion...um, wait. Chris, get over here. How do you spell 'station?' Think about that for a second. How does station have an extra 'O' before the 'I?' Alright, listen to me. Pack your things because you are fired! Get out of my office! Gah, I can’t re-record that message..."
		"cave.cave_06"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: Now, as I said, there’s a lot we’re still working on. Watch your step on your way out. And a reminder: Aperture Science Innovators is not responsible for any injury you sustain, up to and including death by exposure to cosmic ray spallation. Don’t worry, though, we haven’t had an accident like that in 3 days! [sound of papers rustling] Nope, sorry, make that 3 minutes."
		"cave.cave_07"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: We here at Aperture Science Innovators love to give back to the community. So instead of just giving back, we made our own community! Entirely made out of Aperture Science Malleable Concrete on top of the salt mines! And that’s exactly why you shouldn’t touch the walls or stomp your feet either. Last thing we need is to touch up a dent in the wall because someone was too hands-on."
		"cave.cave_08"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: I told you it was easy to find! You’ve found it faster than...any test subject on record! [бурмоче] God that’s not good... Anyway, just head through the door on the right to the elevator. You’ll know the way to go."
		"cave.cave_09"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: So, at first I wanted to put in a long flight of stairs that wound around through the old salt mines down here, give the test subjects a great view of my place. But no! The zoning boards and my bean counters said that’s why they invented elevators! So when someone in a wheelchair threatened to sue, my former boys chickened out on me and built this elevator to go to our temporary offices. I’m still working on those stairs and those guys are working on getting a new job! The stairs aren’t ready though, so get on the stupid elevator."
		"cave.cave_10"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: Here at Aperture, we’re always trying to push the boundaries of science that little bit more. That’s why we’re taking on this new project. When the bean counters told me not to buy a salt mine to do all this science, the first thing they said was 'No, there’s too much space! You can’t suspend something over nothing and pray that a test can happen in thin air!' Well, thanks to some use of the old calculator between the ears and the old ’You’re fired!’ stamp, I came up with the final solution to that. If you can’t anchor something in thin air, why bother trying to make it in the air in the first place! I came up with this..."
		"cave.cave_11"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: Introducing the Aperture Science Innovators Suspended Testing Sphere. Each sphere is suspended in the air anchored to the walls concrete and steel lattice rebar. They seem like the float in the air, but in fact, they don’t! Plus, we can keep building above them. Onward and upward! This salt mine here can take at least 10 of these spheres...per shaft! Nine shafts, 90 tests! We can test whatever we want to, and beat out that other company...Black Mesa...those guys can kiss my...[murmuring from someone else over the mic] Anyway, the bean counters cried at the cost of something like this like big babies, but they wet their pants when I threw them out the door! I pay the bills, I make the decisions ’round here. And I hire and fire as I please! The first of these should be ready in a few more months, so you’ll be participating in one of our smaller tests: the Aperture Science Innovators Short-Term Relaxation Vault."
		"cave.cave_12"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: When you get to the offices, I’ll let you in on a bit more. This test should be really easy for you though. Just get inside one of the Aperture Science Innovators Short-Term Relaxation Vaults and lay in a bed! You’ll feel yourself fall asleep quickly. Don’t worry though, our science boys will get you out shortly. You’ll be out for only a few minutes, an hour at most if something goes wrong. We’ve got everything under control. You’ll be making science! And you won’t have to do a thing! Who’s the winner here? You are."
		"cave.cave_13"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: So, as I said on the last pre-recorded message, you’ll be heading into an Aperture Science Innovators Short-Term Relaxation Vault for a quick, deep sleep...and then you’re done! That’s why you came here at night; you’re most likely a walking zombie. That’ll give us the best results. But just remember, don’t sleep too long. This isn’t a bed and breakfast and if you decide to stay the night, I’m charging you rent for the next year. We’ll have a bed ready for you, just follow the testing area signs and go to bed. Don’t mind the turrets; they’re firing blanks. Least that’s what Crazy Harry told me. Had 6 science boys disappear because of him."
		"cave.cave_14"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: Don’t worry, those turrets won’t kill you. The safety on their guns is on. Had some lab boys shut them down. Crazy Harry lied to me."
		"cave.cave_15"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: If you’re hearing this message, you’re at the sleeping chambers. Caroline, is the test ready?"
		"cave.cave_16"	"<clr:255,105,180>Керолайн: Yes sir, Mr. Johnson!"
		"cave.cave_17"	"<clr:195,214,155>Кейв Джонсон: Then you’re good to go. Step into the chamber and get into the bed. Our lab boys will take care of the rest."
		"virgil.Virgil_01"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Is...Is this thing on? Hello? Hello? Can you hear me? Oh, right, you can’t answer. [відкашлюється] I’m so sorry, astronaut, Olympian, or war hero...there was a...slight problem with the test. Don’t worry, though, we got you out OK. Nothing’s different, nothing’s changed. Just...head out of the chamber. I’ll tell you a bit more out there."
		"virgil.Virgil_02"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Uh, don’t worry about that. It’s just, um, uh...a new drilling test we’re doing down below. Yeah, to get the salt mines deeper to get more testing spheres in. Yeah, that’s it. Just, ignore that."
		"virgil.Virgil_03"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Don’t mind all this too. We’ve just had...um, earthquakes. Lots of earthquakes, yeah. Get lots of those here in Michigan."
		"virgil.Virgil_04"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Don’t worry about the height. Had a few of my scientists make what’s called Long Fall Bo...I mean...Aperture: Science Innovators Long-Fall...Boots... [бурмоче] Huh, that was easier to think up than I thought..."
		"virgil.Virgil_05"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Pick that yellow device up. Don’t worry, it’s not hazardous. I’ve had the scientists leave you a...new device to help you. Yeah, that’s right, a new test! Congratulations! You get to test something else now! Double the experiments for you!"
		"virgil.Virgil_06"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: There’s an open door nearby. Should take you out of the building. You’ll need that new test to move around ...Don’t worry though! We built the building like this!"
		"virgil.Virgil_07"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: These earthquakes even shook up time a bit...some stuff from the future got here. Yeah, that’s how it’s here. Don’t worry, it’s still 1952. Adlai Stevenson is still president..."
		"virgil.Virgil_08"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Alright, so, the earthquakes...kind of did some...redecorating in here. Destroyed the door too. You’ll have to find another way out."
		"virgil.Virgil_09"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: There’s gotta be something you can use to launch yourself over the door. There has to be another way out."
		"virgil.Virgil_10"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: I know things might look different than what you’re used to, but uh, while you were spending that little time sleeping, we had some, some uh...Aperture Science nanomachines come in and build all this stuff! Yeah, that’s it! They’re quick little guys, faster than any science guy I’ve got."
		"virgil.Virgil_11"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Beyond that door is one of the new testing tracks. Totally completely new. Get through it and head to the first testing sphere. I’ll let you know more there."
		"virgil.Virgil_12"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Now, I just want to make sure you know something before you go any further. We have these new inventions called Emancipation Grids in place to prevent objects from moving around to other tests. Now, some guy decided that it would be a good idea to make ones that prevent people from going through. And installed one where people needed to go through."
		"virgil.Virgil_13"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: If you turn the power off, you can easily turn it back on. That switch isn’t like the rest of them. The others trip a circuit breaker that causes an entire part of the facility’s power grid to blow up. So remember. The one in here is good. All others, bad."
		"virgil.Virgil_14"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Remember you can always easily turn the power on or off again."
		"virgil.Virgil_15"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Head inside the building again, try to see if you can do something with the power turned off."
		"virgil.Virgil_16"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Head inside the building again, try to see if you can do something with the power turned on."
		"virgil.Virgil_17"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: I think these switches were designed for two people. Maybe your… erm… new test can help!"
		"virgil.Virgil_18"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: The new testing track is just through here!"
		"virgil.Virgil_19"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Oh! That’s meant to happen! Just to test..  er.. your… reflexes! You know, after your short sleep!"
		"virgil.Virgil_20"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Ah yes, Bravo Volta, the...hold on...fifth testing track. Yes, fifth. You’ll need a portal device to get through. Um, sorry...I meant a portable...quantum...tunneling...device. Look, it’s in your hands right now! The scientists did their job! You’ll do fine."
		"virgil.Virgil_21"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Now, everything about this test is lead-lined, according to my 1950s notes, here in my 1950s filing cabinet. Says it’s harmful to humans, I mean...not harmful to humans. You’ll be OK. Perfectly fine. Nothing to worry about...Oh, and don’t worry about the boxes. We’ve got a ton backstocked ready for this kind of thing. Thrown at the wall, destroyed, rinse and repeat. Useless little things. Made them in an hour."
		"virgil.Virgil_22"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Phew! Good, you’re not dead. That means that high toxicity lead didn’t get in the air and...I mean, uh...Great job, astronaut, Olympian, or war hero! You really are a merit to science...or something like that...Just remember the Nuremberg Olympics!"
		"virgil.Virgil_23"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Now, see, this test uses the new Aperture Science Innovators Propulsion Gel. It allows you to...no, wait...hold on..."
		"virgil.Virgil_24"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: This record says they didn’t make that until the seventies..."
		"virgil.Virgil_25"	"<clr:255,192,0>Кейв Джонсон: Never you mind that. Just solve science!"
		"virgil.Virgil_26"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, hold up a second Mel. I don’t think you’re that stupid that you’re going to fall for this anymore. I’ll be blunt now: I’m not Cave Johnson. This isn’t the 1950s. Everyone you knew and loved is dead. And now you’re stuck here in Aperture Science, down with the trash. Like me."
		"virgil.Virgil_27"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: After everyone left because of that boat."
		"virgil.Virgil_28"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Which I’m sure you already knew, but eh, whatever. However...I can get us out of here, if you’re willing to let a voice in the sky who just told you he was lying the entire time he was talking to you control nearly every movement you make. Is that OK? I’ll...I’ll just take your silence as yes...Right...you can’t answer me. Gaah, just do what I say and you’ll be fine, OK?"
		"virgil.Virgil_29"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: So, about before...you can get why I said all that, right? I’d rather not have my one chance of escape have a panic attack and die on me after years of being suspended in a faulty relaxation vault, which could be a real possibility because as my records show, that old test could cause heart attacks after small exposure to the chemicals. And you were pumped full of them. So, let’s all just take a breath and start over. My name’s Virgil. I’m a core from up in the Enrichment Center. Before you even think of asking, yes, there’s a building above you and yes I came from it. I’m not crazy. Don’t be too alarmed, though. A lot’s changed since you got put on ice."
		"virgil.Virgil_30"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Good job Mel...see that pipe there, that the repulsion gel’s leaking on? That’ll take you to the pumping station. Jump down and walk on it. Oh, and try not to fall off. That goo down there’s corrosive, and it doesn’t like human skin."
		"virgil.Virgil_31"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, I know what you’re thinking...what on earth is going on here? Well, Aperture’s early tests...weren’t always that successful. You were unlucky. That was the worst tests Cave Johnson ever greenlit. But, it’s nice for me to have an Olympian at my disposal. Yeah, I have that information from you at the 1936 Nuremberg Olympics. You should have gotten that silver medal!"
		"virgil.Virgil_32"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Now, according to my records of this room, there should be a turret shooting range at the far side of the room. If you can get through there, you should be able to get to the fourth testing track. That’ll take you up to where I am."
		"virgil.Virgil_33"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: The Propulsion gel pump seems to be offline. You got to turn it on somehow. There’s a control room above you. Find a way to get up there. Now."
		"virgil.Virgil_34"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Huh. That was odd. Normally when people do that sort of thing they just fly through the hole in the wall. Guess not this time."
		"virgil.Virgil_35"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Good, that gel should help you get past those turrets!"
		"virgil.Virgil_36"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Good, you got around that. There should be an override switch on the wall. If you pull it,  it will open the door!"
		"virgil.Virgil_37"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Ah, great. Should be a straight shot to the next testing track. Go to that door down at the very end. You know, the one with the giant wheel on it."
		"virgil.Virgil_38"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Do it again. It’ll open this time, I swear. Just give it some elbow grease."
		"virgil.Virgil_39"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Oh, come on! You’ve got this! One more shot."
		"virgil.Virgil_40"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Well, great. You can fling yourself all over the place and get past some old turrets that are firing live rounds, but you can’t get a door open?! What kind of Olympian are you! Gaaah! Alright, let’s see what we can do... there’s a longer route through a repulsion gel pumping station. Guess you’re going to have to go that way."
		"virgil.Virgil_41"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: So, there’s two ways out of that room. Both are on catwalks up near the top of the room. Consider yourself lucky; they seem to still be intact...mostly, unlike everything else down in this pit. Go through there. There’s a connecting bridge to the next testing tack over there."
		"virgil.Virgil_42"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: You can get through this pumping station and prepare yourself to get out of BRAVO VOLTA, into the LIMA WHISKEY testing track. That should bring you closer to me, and to your own escape from this facility!"
		"virgil.Virgil_43"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Aaaaand our good luck just ran out. I can’t override the locks to that test chamber. Maybe...maybe there’s a way...over it? See if there’s anything you can use."
		"virgil.Virgil_44"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, look...I’m sorry for what I said back there. [sigh] We’re in this together. You’re my ticket out of this junkyard down here, I’m your ticket to the outside world. I’ll...I’ll do my best to keep the insults at a minimum. Just...try harder next time."
		"virgil.Virgil_45"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Good, you know how to find the elevator out of here. Don’t get me wrong, I admire your enthusiasm, but I would have told you if that was working. They boarded it up when they kept building above this facility. Sorry, but that’s not gonna do anything. The chairs are comfy, though!"
		"virgil.Virgil_46"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Sorry to say this, but there’s nothing of value up there. Nothing at all. You’re wasting your time. Nothing life-changing up there at all!"
		"virgil.Virgil_47"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: See? I told you. Mel...we need to talk. I know some cores lie really badly about things like that, but I was telling the truth. Trust me a little more. Oh, and I hope you enjoy the long walk down!"
		"virgil.Virgil_48"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Um...I kind of have a bit of bad news. Yeah, yeah, I know, you don’t want to hear any more bad news after the security override I couldn’t do. My records of this sphere are...out of date to say the least. There should be an exit after the third section of this test. However...I don’t know if getting there will be that easy. You’ve got it in you, though. You’re my Olympian...who might not have a beating heart anymore..."
		"virgil.Virgil_49"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Wait a second...I’m getting some...strange voice coming through. I’ll patch it through."
		"aegis.Audio 1_bip"	"<clr:85,142,213>ЕҐІДА: Scanning LIMA WHISKEY 70% complete. No vital signs detected, initiating flooding procedure."
		"virgil.Virgil_50"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: That’s coming up from New Apert…"
		"virgil.Virgil_51"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: What the?! My scans are going nuts! Something’s happening! That sphere is unstable! Get out of there! RUN!!!"
		"virgil.Virgil_52"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Holy smokes!"
		"virgil.Virgil_53"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: That explosion blew the whole toxic goo pump station apart! It’s letting flood waters out! We’ve got to get out of here! It’s not safe! Get through the control centers! There’s a transition seal leading up to where I am! Hurry! Before this whole place floods or comes down!"
		"virgil.Virgil_54"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Your life is at stake and you’re going to walk up the stairs? With falling rocks everywhere? I get you’re an Olympic track runner and all, but what’s wrong with you?!"
		"virgil.Virgil_55"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: The place is exploding, rocks are falling everywhere, and you’re taking the elevator?! What if the power went out?! You’d be trapped!"
		"virgil.Virgil_56"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: You’ve got to get out of there! This room’s filling with smoke!"
		"virgil.Virgil_57"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Good, at least you won’t suffocate in this room, but you still need to find a way to get to the transition seal! Is there anything you can use to put out the fire or something?"
		"virgil.Virgil_58"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Woah! Don’t do that! You want to bring the place down on your head?!"
		"virgil.Virgil_59"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: I’m reading you blew a water pipe. I got an idea!  There’s got to be water pouring out somewhere!"
		"virgil.Virgil_60"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: I...I can’t believe that worked! Oh, right...get going, before something else happens."
		"virgil.Virgil_61"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Wow! If you’d been there a few seconds earlier you’d have been incinerated! Thank the maker you weren’t, though. *quick sigh* I need the muscle."
		"virgil.Virgil_62"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: OK, bad news. When the pump station blew, the floodgates opened up wide. Toxic goo’s rising fast; the sensors maxed out ages ago. Warning lights are going crazy all around. This just got a lot more serious."
		"virgil.Virgil_63"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, you’re a Quality Control Center 95-D. Only a bit further and you’ll be at the hatch up to me. Hurry! I’ll try to slow the goo down a bit!"
		"virgil.Virgil_64"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Gah, the door won’t open from this side! Maybe there’s...some way around or something?"
		"virgil.Virgil_65"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Great job Mel, you’re on the other side of that door now! Yes! Very good!"
		"virgil.Virgil_66"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Oh great! Another blocked corridor [sigh]"
		"virgil.Virgil_67"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: So, Mel, why don’t you take your time and look around here. I’ll try to slow the rising goo down a little bit harder I guess… Just don’t take all day…"
		"virgil.Virgil_68"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Gaaah, you can almost reach the air vent, but it seems a bit too high to jump in. The desk can help, but it doesn’t look to be high enough. Try to find something to climb on."
		"virgil.Virgil_69"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Maybe that cube will help you reach the airvent!"
		"virgil.Virgil_70"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: The doors are locked? Um... back in the day the wiring was a bit strange some times. Try turning some machinery on, see if that also unlocks the doors."
		"virgil.Virgil_71"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Wow, th-that actually worked? Great!"
		"virgil.Virgil_72"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Well, that’s just great. Can’t we get through a room once without stuff blowing up or blocking our way?! Gah! Try to find some water again or something."
		"virgil.Virgil_73"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Great. From there, there’s just the vault. Don’t get comfy, though. I’ve pulled the plug on some emergency runoff dams, but the goo’s still rising."
		"virgil.Virgil_74"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Wow, this place is massive! Whoever built this place must be a great architect."
		"virgil.Virgil_75"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Up high, at the backside of this room is a control panel, it controls the hatch, try to get there!"
		"virgil.Virgil_76"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: My records show that at least two people were needed to activate the vault hatch. You’re one person. There’s a bit of a problem there. I’m sure you can figure something out."
		"virgil.Virgil_77"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Ah, great! You’re smarter than I thought! Not a genius like me, but still. Take the elevator up to me. I’m in the junkyard just outside the hatch. It’s finally time for me to repay my end of the deal."

		"virgil.Virgil_185"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Looks like AEGIS is still pumping up the toxic goo out of the salt mines. It’s flooded the lower chambers and is rising fast. We don’t have much time. We’ve got to stop it."
		"virgil.Virgil_186"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Nice, the compile finished. Let’s see… this is the final working test chamber. The next one is broken, but it should give us an opportunity to get to AEGIS. We might need to go through a cube production facility first though."
		"virgil.Virgil_187"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: The next chamber is the broken one. From there on you’ll have to move fast, because that’s the last chamber with plants in it."

		"virgil.Virgil_190"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: We’ll be going through the Weighted Storage Cube manufacturing. It’s now or never.

		"virgil.Virgil_203"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: This reminds me of the day I ended up falling down into those junkyard offices. Dark room, no lights, hit the end of a management rail and down I went.

		"virgil.Virgil_210"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Fine, fine, I see how it is! You want to drown in the toxic goo. I guess we can wait for that. Rather an anticlimax after everything you’ve been through."

		"virgil.Virgil_212"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Um...look...Mel...I just wanted to say something. I...I couldn’t have done any of this without your help. If it wasn’t for you, I’d still be stuck down there in the junkyard offices, probably my battery back-up would have run out in a few days. So...thanks..."
		"virgil.Virgil_213"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: So...let’s get this done. Whatever happens...I believe in you, really."

		"virgil.Virgil_214"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, so in order to get to the AEGIS core we need to turn on the power, unlock the doors and replace the turrets. Once that’s done, we should have a clear shot at AEGIS. Let’s get going!"
		"virgil.Virgil_215"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Every vent in here is filled with those turrets. We pulled up every last one of them a long time ago!"
		"virgil.Virgil_216"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: OK, Mel, I’m reading that the generators are offline. Only way that the security systems can come online, is to turn on those generators. But, according to my research, the manual start-up is over in the control room for generator 2...and it’s locked. The control room for generator 1 has a manual security override though. Give it a try. What’s the worst that could happen?"
		"virgil.Virgil_217"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: OK, I was wrong, I was wrong! That was a bad idea! The security system kicked in. You can’t open the doors from the inside anymore! Hurry! Find a way to turn that other generator on and then get out of here!"
		"virgil.Virgil_218"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: W-Wait...you just...how did you?...Well, I guess manual bypass does work, doesn’t it? Good work. That’s the first part. The security systems are now...online...wait, I didn’t think this through, did I?"
		"virgil.Virgil_219"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Aaaaaaaand alright, now that we have the power turned on, we need to go to the security room overlooking the bridge to the AEGIS core. Now that the security doors have unlocked, we should be able to get there."
		"virgil.Virgil_220"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, so...I think that might not be as easy as I once thought. AEGIS has done...quite a lot of redecorating on those catwalks. Good thing you’ve got a portal gun..."

		"virgil.Virgil_222"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Watch it, he’s got another one coming! And I think this one took out the catwalks before! Avoid those turrets and get to the security room!"
		"virgil.Virgil_223"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Ah, great, you’re there. There should be a switch around in this room. Once you flip it, AEGIS’s main security systems will go down. Then it should be a straight shot to the core!"

		"virgil.Virgil_224"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Ah, right, the turrets. Well, it seems he’s diverted all the power that was going to the death fizzlers into the turret production. Which...hang on, that’s not so bad. Get back to the elevator room. Time to turn the tables on AEGIS."
		"virgil.Virgil_225"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, all that’s left is those turrets. Remember how we pumped up the old turrets? This is where they might get useful. Head to manufacturing line."
		"virgil.Virgil_226"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: OK, here’s the plan. We’ve got to take the turret production line down. So, there’s about three ways I know to do this. The first should be easy and works most of the time. Go into the scanner area and take the turret out. Without a model, the turrets can’t be built!"
		"virgil.Virgil_227"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: So, that didn’t work. Computer’s got a template stored. Which leads us to solution number two. Use one of the old turrets to overwrite the template. I can reprogram it to not shoot you, and before you know you’ve got an army!"
		"virgil.Virgil_228"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Erm, scratch that idea. Apparently there are no diversity vents here. Which means I can’t bring one in. I guess pumping up those turrets was a total waste of time. Lovely. So, third idea. We’ve gotta override the targeting system of these ones...manually. There is a targeting control room. It’s nearby. Just be ready to run. I’ll get the door open!"
		"virgil.Virgil_229"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: See you on the other side! And just remember! The Nuremberg Olympics!"
		"virgil.Virgil_230"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Ah, there you are! I knew all that track running would do you good some day! Look, that wood model is what’s causing the turrets to shoot at humans. If you replace it, with something else they’ll shoot that instead!"
		"virgil.Virgil_231"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Maybe try the server template?"
		"virgil.Virgil_232"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Place the wooden server in the scanner, that should make it shoot servers instead of humans!"
		"virgil.Virgil_233"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Oh my! You’re clever! Now the turrets will target the server banks instead of you! If we wait a little bit all the turrets in this part of the facility should be replaced, allowing you to finally destroy AEGIS."
		"virgil.Virgil_234"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Why don’t you test if the re-programming worked? Stand in front of the model. One of two things will happen. The first... they won’t shoot you. The second... erm… well, it shouldn’t come to that! Just trust me!"
		"virgil.Virgil_235"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright! That worked! I knew that would work! Totally knew it’d work…"
		"virgil.Virgil_236"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Hmm, well, anyway, the turrets are ours now. Now, get back to the elevator room again. Time to bring the fight to him."
		"virgil.Virgil_237"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Oh, forgot to mention, those turrets were automatically replaced by the system, as it read that there was an update to the turrets’ targeting systems. Every update, they get replaced to make sure the turrets are the most up-to-date they can be. And to prevent hacking."
		"virgil.Virgil_238"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: That’s the Emergency Exit Elevator. Once we shut down AEGIS we should be able to use it to get you out of here! Unfortunately there are no management rails in there, so you’ll have to do it without me. Don’t worry though, I’ll be watching from back here and help you if needed."
		"virgil.Virgil_239"	"<clr:255,192,0>Верґілій: Alright, Mel, this is it. This is AEGIS’s server room. Get ready for this. It won’t give up without a fight..."
